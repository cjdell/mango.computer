## Wednesday 12th November 2014 - Concurrency in Go

[Please register](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/11ta8mZ3ZeSHWWMdwQXNoifRQ0-CuwJkm3AUgtXYy3o0/viewform) for the meetup if you're going to attend!

On the day if you need any help with the meetup call Will on 07939 547 962.

### The session

This month Peter Waller will be diving into concurrency with a talk that starts off easily and then dives deeper into the technical aspects of writing concurrent Go. The session will be semi-interactive, with plenty of time for questions and discussion.

### Before arriving

If you are bringing a laptop please charge it before arriving as we cannot guarantee plug sockets for all.

It would be useful to have Go installed on your laptops beforehand to save time and avoid any issues downloading Go on the venue's WiFi.

To install Go, follow the relevant guide for your operating system:

* [OSX](https://golang.org/doc/install#osx) or via Homebrew (brew install go)
* [Linux](https://golang.org/doc/install#tarball)
* [Windows](https://golang.org/doc/install#windows)

You should now be able to run "go version" and see the version of Go you have installed. You might also want to familiarise yourself with GO a little by trying out the [online tour](http://tour.golang.org/#1).

### About the Organiser

> Peter Waller is a Technical Architect and engineer at [ScraperWiki](https://scraperwiki.com/), where he does a little bit of everything -  from throwing together Go daemons, to product design and development, to sysadmin. He got interested in Go whilst being a PhD student on the CERN ATLAS experiment searching for a new particle.

### Schedule

* 7:00pm :: Introduction to Go workshop
* 8:00pm :: Q&A
* After  :: Post-talk drinks at Marble (57 Thomas street)
