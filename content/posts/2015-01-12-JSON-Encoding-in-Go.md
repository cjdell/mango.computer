## Wednesday 14th January 2015 - JSON Encoding in Go

[Please register](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/11ta8mZ3ZeSHWWMdwQXNoifRQ0-CuwJkm3AUgtXYy3o0/viewform) for the meetup if you're going to attend!

On the day if you need any help with the meetup call Will on 07939 547 962.

### The session

This month Lewis Marshall will be demonstrating how the Go `encoding/json` package makes handling JSON data and writing JSON schemas simple!

### Before arriving

If you are bringing a laptop please charge it before arriving as we cannot guarantee plug sockets for all.

It would be useful to have Go installed on your laptops beforehand to save time and avoid any issues downloading Go on the venue's WiFi.

To install Go, follow the relevant guide for your operating system:

* [OSX](https://golang.org/doc/install#osx) or via Homebrew (brew install go)
* [Linux](https://golang.org/doc/install#tarball)
* [Windows](https://golang.org/doc/install#windows)

You should now be able to run "go version" and see the version of Go you have installed. You might also want to familiarise yourself with Go a little by trying out the [online tour](http://tour.golang.org/#1).

### About the Organiser

> Lewis Marshall is a freelance coder who mainly writes Ruby web apps, but has recently got into Go through contributing to [Flynn](https://flynn.io), an open source, next generation PaaS.
