## Wednesday 10th August 2016 - Go Surgery

This month is pretty free-form. Things we will be doing this month:

* Never programmed Go and curious? Get an introduction to the language from someone who has worked with it.
* Want to talk to an experienced Go programmer about the strengths and weaknesses of the language?
* Bring along some code you're struggling with and we can help.
* If people want to give it a go and we have time some people may attempt the Crypto challenge from a few months back: [The Cryptographic Challenge](/posts/2016/01/26/The-Cryptographic-Challenge).

### Taking part

If you do have a laptop, bring it along and make sure you have [Go installed](/posts/2016/01/26/Installing-Go).

### Schedule

* 6:30pm :: Door open, meet the group
* 7:00pm :: The session
* 8:00pm :: Drinks at a local bar

### Location

This month we have a change of venue and will be meeting at [MadLab](http://madlab.org.uk/). [Directions](http://madlab.org.uk/find-us/).
