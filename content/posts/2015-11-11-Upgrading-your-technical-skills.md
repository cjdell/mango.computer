## Wednesday 11th November 2015 - Upgrading Your Technical Skills

On the day if you need any help with the meetup call Will on 07939 547 962.

### The session

This week we will be joining up with [NWRUG](http://nwrug.org/) as they have what could be an interesting talk on the same day as our meetup.

In this talk Ali is going to share thoughts about improving your technical abilities. In particular he's going to talk about how to think about how "good" a developer you are, how to choose what to focus on and practical techniques for improving your skills and knowledge.

### About the Speaker

He occasionally writes and speaks about matters related to technology and business for whoever has the patience to listen to him. His friends just call him Ali, so you should call him Ali!
