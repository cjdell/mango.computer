[Please register](https://docs.google.com/a/basecamp.com/forms/d/1JgGtkV_h02jNyjH1pDXwZK20c9oSi8o9JPrBf8bqBmo/viewform) for the meetup if you're going to attend!

On the day if you need any help with the meetup call Will on 07939 547 962.

### The session

How do you make a complicated program fast? You look for the bottlenecks. Peter will talk about the fundamentals of modern program profiling and show you how go makes it extremely easy to see where it's best to invest your effort in making your code fast. We'll peek at what it takes to reduce a many hour process to a few seconds.
