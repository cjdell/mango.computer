### The talks

Both our talks this month are by Lee Hambley, co-founder of [Harrow.io](http://Harrow.io).

#### I Can't Write Ruby Anymore

A short talk about moving from one of the world's slowest languages optimised for happiness, to one of the fastest, optimised for being able to sleep at night. Intended for Rubyists to learn some of the pros, and cons of moving to Go for some, or all of their daily needs.

#### Transactional HTTP Tests With Go's Standard Library.

Kitchen-sink frameworks such as Rails include massive amounts of code designed to help with easy out of the box testing through the whole stack. In this talk I'll discuss the tooling I came up with to emulate the good parts of the Rails database migrations, and transactional tests and fixtures fixtures using some of Go's excellent standard library.

### About the Speaker
