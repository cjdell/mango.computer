This month we're running a hack session: [The Cryptographic Challenge](/posts/2016/01/26/The-Cryptographic-Challenge).

### Taking part

Don't worry if you can't bring a laptop or are new to Go as there will be opportunities to pair program or simply observe others. If you do have a laptop, bring it along and make sure you have [Go installed](/posts/2016/01/26/Installing-Go).
