<p>This week we will be joining up with <a href="http://nwrug.org/">NWRUG</a> as they have what could be an interesting talk on the same day as our meetup.</p>

<p>In this talk Ali is going to share thoughts about improving your technical abilities. In particular he’s going to talk about how to think about how “good” a developer you are, how to choose what to focus on and practical techniques for improving your skills and knowledge.</p>
