<p>The talk this month is by Lewis Marshall.</p>

<h4 id="containerised-deployments-with-flynn">Containerised deployments with Flynn</h4>

<p><a href="https://flynn.io">Flynn</a> is an open source platform aiming to simplify the deployment of distributed applications and services, primarily written in Go. I plan to talk about some of the many components which make up Flynn, and do a quick demo of actually running and deploying to a Flynn cluster.</p>
